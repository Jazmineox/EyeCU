<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About EyeCU


Disease is everywhere. However, due to our continuously advancing society in technology, we are becoming better at categorizing and identifying the early stages of diseases. 
Our web application EyeCU, will be able to determine what eye disease a user may have based off of a picture that will be taken and uploaded by the user, which will be processed by in our application.


Some Key features:
* Login/Logout System with google sign-in enabled
* Photo upload for users
* Appointment making with local physicians
