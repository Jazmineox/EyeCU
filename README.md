<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About EyeCU


Disease is everywhere. However, due to our continuously advancing society in technology, we are becoming better at categorizing and identifying the early stages of diseases. 
Our web application EyeCU, will be able to determine what eye disease a user may have based off of a picture that will be taken and uploaded by the user, which will be processed by in our application.


Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.
